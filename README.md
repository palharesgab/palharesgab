Hello, my name is Gabriel Palhares, but everyone calls me Palhares, I am 21 years old and was born in Vila Velha, ES.   
    
    
I started in programming when I was 17, introduced to programming logic and making terminal programs in Python. When I turned 18, I went to college, and there I could learn more about computing and see several areas for a career in software development. I have experience with fullstack development, but I like to focus my studies on back-end and DevOps culture. I am a very creative, proactive, critical and organized person.
